Version

  CMS 8.0

Overview

  In CMS8.0, the security domain data has been migrated into the 
  internal LDAP database to allow easier replication of this data
  when cloning.  Prior to this release, this information was stored
  in the domain.xml configuration file on the CA serving as the Domain 
  Master.  

Program

  MigrateSecurityDomain - This command will add the relevant schema and migrate 
  security domain data that resides in domain.xml into the internal database.  
  The program needs only two arguments - the location of the instance root directory 
  (like /var/lib/pki-ca) and the directory user's password.

Example

  Here is an example of MigrateSecurityDomain usage
java -cp /usr/share/java/ldapjdk.jar:/usr/share/java/pki/cmscore.jar:/usr/share/java/pki/cmsutil.jar:/usr/share/java/pki/certsrv.jar:.  MigrateSecurityDomain  /var/lib/pki-ca  mypassword
