IMPORTANT:  To build, it is recommended to still checkout the git source using
            SVN since the associated internal repo is still in SVN and needs
            to remain there due to its use of "svn:externals"!

svn checkout https://github.com/dogtagpki/legacy-pki.git/branches/PKI_8_1_ADVANCED_ERRATA_BRANCH/pki pki
